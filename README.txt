Please start with the pepperfrontpage.html.

Features I used:

Read and parse an external file into your application.

• This is done with my store table. I have a json file that I hold all my ordering data. In this JSON file each pepper type has several pieces of information including the amount of Pepper’s ordered. This data is then used to create my bar graph.

Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation.

• I used chart.js to graph my data in a bar graph. This data is taken from my JSON file and graphs the order quantity vs. Pepper type.


Create and use a function that accepts two or more values, calculates or determines a new value based on

• For this I have a place where the user can input two values- length and width- and the area and number of plants is returned.


Calculate and display data based on an external factor.

• For this I have a countdown to the number of days until summer.

Retrieve data from and external API and display in your app

	▪	This is done with my weather API.  The api pulls the current weather based off of the users location.  From that the user can get information about the current weather.


Next steps would be to add my e-commerce link to my store and add and update my contact form.
